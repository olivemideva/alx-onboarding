START
declare all variables that is int, sq_int
set int to 0
prompt user to input int
let sq_int be n
set n to int^2 to find the squareroot of the users input

create a for loop that starts from 0 to n, n being the squareroot of the user's input
in the loop find the sum of the squared numbers using sum= sum + n

end for loop

output sum
