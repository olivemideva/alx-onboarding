START

create an array A to hold all the numbers that will be inserted which in this case are just 3
declare two variables int gap and valueToInsert
int gap
int valueToInsert

create a for loop that chooses a value to be inserted
for i =1 to length of array A inclusive do:
valueToInsert = A[i]
gap = i

using a while loop find a gap where the value is inserted by going through all the values in the array comparing each one of the with the selected value
while gap > 0 and A[gap-1]>valueToInsert do:
A[gap] = A[gap-1]
gap = gap-1
end while

insert the value in the located gap
A[gap] = valueToInsert
end for
